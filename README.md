# PakledCore

Summary: this repository contains a nonsense C# project, its assemblies are published to the NuGet feed of my ASP.NET web site https://www.aspenlaub.net/

## What does *Pakled* mean?

The Pakled are a race from the Star Trek Universe. They appear in a TNG episode called [Samaritan Snare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritan_Snare). With their limited eloquence they fool technically advanced races and appeal to their helper instinct.

In the code you find references to their favorite statements:

* *We look for things*
* *It is broken, can you make it go?*

## Can it be useful to you?

Most probably no :wink:
